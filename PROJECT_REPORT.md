# Trendscout - Project Report

## 1. Project Overview

**What Trendscout Does:**

Trendscout is a Python-based backend system designed to automate and enhance digital content strategy through the use of AI agents. It leverages the Crew AI framework to orchestrate multiple AI agents, each specializing in a different aspect of the content lifecycle:

*   **Trend Analysis:** Identifies emerging trends from various data sources.
*   **Content Generation:** Creates engaging post ideas and content based on identified trends.
*   **Scheduling:** Recommends optimal times for publishing content to maximize reach and engagement.

The system is built using FastAPI, providing a robust and high-performance API for interaction. It uses PostgreSQL for persistent data storage, Redis for managing a queue of long-running AI agent tasks, and Ollama for serving local AI models, ensuring flexibility and control over the AI capabilities.

Users can interact with Trendscout via its RESTful API or a simple web-based UI. The UI allows users to log in, submit tasks to individual agents or a "Trend-to-Post" multi-agent crew, and monitor the progress and results of these tasks, including intermediate steps from crew workflows.

The primary goal of Trendscout is to provide an extensible and scalable platform for developers and organizations looking to automate their trend analysis and content creation processes, ultimately leading to more informed and effective digital strategies.

## 2. Implementation Challenges and Solutions

Throughout the development of Trendscout, several technical challenges were encountered. The following outlines key challenges and the solutions implemented:

### Challenge 1: Integrating and Orchestrating Multiple AI Agents
*   **Problem:** Effectively managing individual AI agents (Trend Analyzer, Content Generator, Scheduler) and ensuring they could work together in a coordinated workflow (e.g., the "Trend-to-Post" crew) presented complexity in terms of data handoff, state management, and execution flow.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Crew AI Framework:** Adopted Crew AI as the core framework for defining agents, their tools, and their collaborative workflows (crews). This provided a structured way to manage agent interactions.
    *   **Dedicated Crew Definitions (`crew_defs.py`):** Created specific functions to define and instantiate crews, clearly outlining the sequence of agents and how data/context is passed between them.
    *   **Asynchronous Task Processing:** Leveraged a Redis-based task queue and a dedicated background worker (`worker.py`) to handle the execution of potentially long-running agent and crew tasks. This prevented the API from blocking and improved responsiveness.

### Challenge 2: Capturing and Displaying Intermediate Steps from AI Crews
*   **Problem:** For multi-agent workflows (crews), understanding the output and reasoning of each individual agent within the crew is crucial for debugging and transparency. The initial setup did not capture these intermediate results.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Backend Modifications:**
        *   Enhanced `crew_defs.py` to collect the output from each task within a crew.
        *   Added an `intermediate_steps` field (JSONB type) to the `AgentTask` database model in `models/task.py` to store this structured data.
        *   Updated the `worker.py` to extract and save these intermediate steps to the database.
        *   Modified API schemas (`schemas.py`) to include `intermediate_steps` in task responses.
    *   **Frontend Modifications (`script.js`, `style.css`):**
        *   Updated the UI to parse and display these intermediate steps in a readable format (using `<pre>` tags for pretty-printed JSON), showing the responsible agent, its task, and its output.

### Challenge 3: Ensuring a Reliable and Consistent Development/Deployment Environment
*   **Problem:** Managing multiple services (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Ollama, Worker) and their dependencies, configurations, and startup order can be complex and error-prone across different development machines and for deployment.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Docker and Docker Compose:** Containerized all services using Docker and orchestrated them with Docker Compose. This ensured a consistent environment.
    *   **`.env` File for Configuration:** Centralized environment-specific configurations.
    *   **Service Health Checks and Dependencies:** Implemented health checks in `docker-compose.yml` and used `depends_on` to manage service startup order.
    *   **Entrypoint Scripts (`wait-for-services.sh`, `api-entrypoint.sh`, `ollama-entrypoint.sh`):** Created scripts to:
        *   Ensure dependent services are ready before application services start.
        *   Automate database migrations (Alembic).
        *   Automate initial database setup (e.g., superuser creation).
        *   Automate Ollama model pulling.

### Challenge 4: Structured Logging and Monitoring
*   **Problem:** In a distributed system with multiple components (API, worker, agents), effective logging is essential for debugging, monitoring performance, and tracking requests.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Centralized Logging Module (`core/logging.py`):** Implemented a structured logging system using `python-json-logger`.
    *   **Request Context Tracking:** Added middleware to inject unique request IDs into logs, allowing for easier tracing of requests across services.
    *   **Agent Task Logging:** Included specific logging for agent task lifecycles (creation, processing, completion/failure).
    *   **Performance Monitoring:** Added basic performance monitoring capabilities within the logging framework.

### Challenge 5: User Interface for Task Management and Results Visualization
*   **Problem:** While the API is powerful, a simple UI was needed for easier interaction, especially for demonstrating the capabilities of individual agents and crews, and for visualizing potentially complex, multi-line results.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Simple Static UI (`index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`):** Developed a basic frontend served directly by FastAPI.
    *   **Features:** Implemented user login, task creation (for both single agents and crews), and asynchronous polling for task status updates.
    *   **Improved Readability:** Enhanced `script.js` to pretty-print JSON results and intermediate steps using `<pre>` tags, significantly improving the readability of large text blocks from AI outputs.

By addressing these challenges, Trendscout evolved into a more robust, usable, and maintainable system, effectively demonstrating the integration of AI agents into a modern backend architecture.
